# CRUD_WinformWithJsonFile
Introduction
Imagine you're an employee of a product retailer named FStore. Your manager has asked you to develop a Windows Forms application for member management: MemberID, MemberName, Email, Password, City, Country.

The application has to support adding, viewing, modifying, and removing products—a standardized usage action verbs better known as Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD). This assignment explores creating an application using Windows Forms with .NET Core,  and C#.
